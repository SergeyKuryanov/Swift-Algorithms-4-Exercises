> Weighted quick-union by height. Develop a UF implementation that uses the same basic strategy as weighted quick-union but keeps track of tree height and always links the shorter tree to the taller one.

Key idea is use [Weighted Quick-Union](https://github.com/SergeyKuryanov/Swift-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Union-Find) implementation and modify it a bit. If two subtrees have equal heighs we just add one to another and icrease height by one.

```swift
class WeightedHeightQuickUnion {
    var heights = [Int]()
    var storage = [Int]()

    init(count: Int) {
        heights = Array(repeating: 0, count: count)
        storage += 0..<count
    }

    func root(of node: Int) -> Int {
        var node = node

        while (node != storage[node]) {
            node = storage[node]
        }

        return node
    }

    func union(p: Int, q: Int) {
        let pRoot = root(of: p)
        let qRoot = root(of: q)

        guard pRoot != qRoot else { return }

        let pHeight = heights[pRoot]
        let qHeight = heights[qRoot]

        if pHeight < qHeight {
            storage[pRoot] = qRoot
            heights[qRoot] += pHeight
        } else if pHeight > qHeight {
            storage[qRoot] = pRoot
            heights[pRoot] += qHeight
        } else {
            storage[pRoot] = qRoot
            heights[qRoot] += 1
        }
    }
}
```
