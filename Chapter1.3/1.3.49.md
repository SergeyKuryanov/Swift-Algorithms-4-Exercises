> 1.3.49 Queue with three stacks. Implement a queue with three stacks so that each queue operation takes a constant (worst-case) number of stack operations.

Didn't found solution for 3 stacks, but found amortized constant solution for 2 stacks. Thick is - fill `dequeueStack` when empty with `enqueueStack`.

```swift
struct Queue<T> {
    var dequeueStack = Stack<T>()
    var enqueueStack = Stack<T>()

    mutating func enqueue(_ value: T) {
        enqueueStack.push(value)
    }

    mutating func dequeue() -> T {
        if dequeueStack.count == 0 {
            while enqueueStack.count > 0 {
                dequeueStack.push(enqueueStack.pop())
            }
        }

        return dequeueStack.pop()
    }
}
```
