> 1.3.43 Listing files. A folder is a list of files and folders. Write a program that takes the name of a folder as a command-line argument and prints out all of the files contained in that folder, with the contents of each folder recursively listed (indented) under that folderâ€™s name.

 ```swift
 func contentsOfFolder(_ folderPath: String, nestingLevel: Int) -> String {
    var contents =

    for path in try! fileManager.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: folderPath) {
        contents += contents.padding(toLength: nestingLevel, withPad: " ", startingAt: 0)
        contents += path + "\n"

        let fullPath = folderPath + "/" + path

        var isDirectory: ObjCBool = false
        let exists = fileManager.fileExists(atPath: fullPath, isDirectory: &isDirectory)

        if isDirectory.boolValue {
            contents += contentsOfFolder(fullPath, nestingLevel: nestingLevel + 1)
        }
    }

    return contents
}
 ```
