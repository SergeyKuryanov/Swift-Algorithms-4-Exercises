> Stack generability. Suppose that we have a sequence of intermixed push and pop operations as with our test stack client, where the integers 0, 1, ..., N-1 in that order (push directives) are intermixed with N minus signs (pop directives). Devise an algorithm that determines whether the intermixed sequence causes the stack to under- flow. (You may use only an amount of space independent of Nâ€”you cannot store the integers in a data structure.) Devise a linear-time algorithm that determines whether a given permutation can be generated as output by our test client (depending on where the pop directives occur).

```swift
func generability(_ commands: String) -> Bool {
    var stackCount = 0

    for command in commands {
        if command == "-" {
            stackCount -= 1
        } else {
            stackCount += 1
        }

        if stackCount < 0 { return false }
    }

    return true
}
```
